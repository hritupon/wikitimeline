wikitimeline
============
A Timeline based approach for historical data.
User can maintain chronology of events easily.Simple input process.
It also asks to link to the corresponding wikipedia document of the event and pre populates the description.
While creating events you can simply provide an external link, this program will fetch the relevant data and create the event.

Read wikipedia article in timeline mode. Now you can search any wikipedia article  and see its timeline at runtime.

[Imp: Modify db_connection.php with your db parameters for personal timelines]
Thankful for this plug-in : http://www.technotarek.com/timeliner/.
Twitter Bootstrap is used for the UI.
